_Oh no sequences!_ is the research and development group at [era7 bioinformatics](http://era7bioinformatics.com). We've been doing a lot of R&D at era7 bioinformatics since the start of the company, but _oh no sequences!_ as group officially started at the spring of 2011. Since then, we'd released [bio4j](http://bio4j.com) and [bg7](http://bg7.ohnosequences.com), and did a lot of work on the data analysis from the EHEC outbreak (annotating _all_ released genomes, setting up and coordinating a [github repo](http://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis), etc)
