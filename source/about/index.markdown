_Oh no sequences!_ is the research and development group at [era7 bioinformatics](http://era7bioinformatics.com). 

We've been doing a lot of R&D at era7 bioinformatics since the start of the company, but _oh no sequences!_ as a group officially started at the spring of 2011. Since then, we'd 

- released [bio4j](http://bio4j.com), UniprotKB + GeneOntology + NCBI taxonomy + RefSeq + Expasy Enzyme, integrated in a graph DB with easy [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) deployment.
- released [bg7](http://bg7.ohnosequences.com), our bacterial genome annotations system, designed from the ground up for NGS data.
- did a lot of work on the crowdsourced data analysis from the EHEC outbreak: annotated _all_ released genomes, set up and coordinated the [github repository](http://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis) and [wiki](http://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki), etc.

## interests ##

As our name suggests, we're interested in _sequences_; but in lots of other things too: cloud computing, graph DBs, ... However, everything we do revolves in one way or another around **bacterial genomics**.
