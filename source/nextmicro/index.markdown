**NEXTMICRO**: _a bioinformatics platform designed to manage NGS outbreak data_ is a project partially funded by the Spanish CDTI (_Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnol√≥gico Industrial_) and is being and will be developed during 2012 and 2013.

The goal of the project is the development of a platform able to manage all NGS data related with an outbreak.

It includes our BG7 annotation system ([PLOS ONE paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049239)) and new Cloud Computing pipelines and services specifically designed or adapted to manage NGS data related with hospital and community outbreaks.
