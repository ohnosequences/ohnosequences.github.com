_Oh no sequences!_ is the R&D (Research and Development) group at [era7 bioinformatics](http://era7bioinformatics.com). 

We work on things related with bioinformatics (NGS data analysis), (mostly bacterial) genomics, cloud computing, graph databases, and even category theory! more on our interests at [about](/about). 

You can get a general overview of what we do by looking at a sample of our current [projects](/projects), or by going to our [github account](https://github.com/ohnosequences); as **everything** we do is **open source** (concretely [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) licensed) that can also be a good way to know about what we're at. And of course there's also the [publications](/publications) page, or our [blog](/blog).


We are a healthy mix of people with wildly different backgrounds: Biology, Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Mathematics. ake a look at [people](/people) for the whole list.
