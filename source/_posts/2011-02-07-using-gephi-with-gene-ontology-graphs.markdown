It's already been a couple of weeks since we started integratingÂ [**Gephi**](http://gephi.org/) in some of our services and projects and I must say I'm quite impressed with the results so far.

One of the first uses we found for it was representing gene ontology protein annotations and Go Slim analysis.

Here you can see a graph representation of a protein set gene ontology annotations. Different colors have been applied to each ontology (_molecular function, biological process and cellular component_). Besides, nodes size is proportional to protein annotations number.
