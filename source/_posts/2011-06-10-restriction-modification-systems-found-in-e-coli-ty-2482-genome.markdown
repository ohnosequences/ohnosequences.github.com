Analysing the automatic annotation we did of the second BGI assembly of TY-2482 genome (see post here [http://blog.ohnosequences.com/2011/06/automatic-annotation-of-the-second-bgi-assembly-of-e-coli-ty-2482-genome/](http://blog.ohnosequences.com/2011/06/automatic-annotation-of-the-second-bgi-assembly-of-e-coli-ty-2482-genome/)) we have found that this isolate has 3 restriction modification systems

- Type I Restriction modification system encoded in an operon in contig 42. The specific protein encoded by the gene 79712, the modification protein encoded by the gene 84400 and the restriction protein encoded by 66267
- Type II system encoded in an operon in contig 486. The nuclease protein encoded by the gene 21919 and the methyltransferase protein encoded by gene 23135
- Type III system encoded in the contig 493. The nuclease protein encoded by the gene 3634 and the methyltransferase one encoded by gene 5265
