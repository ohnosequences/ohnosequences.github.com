I was wondering the other day how would the whole [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org/) look like in [Gephi](http://gephi.org/). After realizing that it exporting the ontology to a gexf file could be pretty easy I couldn't resist to give a try.
Soon enough I realized that representing the three sub-ontologies of [GO](http://www.geneontology.org/) (_biological process, cellular component and molecular function_) at the same time was kind of too much. So in the end I decided to start with the smallest one (_cellular component_), and this is what I got.
