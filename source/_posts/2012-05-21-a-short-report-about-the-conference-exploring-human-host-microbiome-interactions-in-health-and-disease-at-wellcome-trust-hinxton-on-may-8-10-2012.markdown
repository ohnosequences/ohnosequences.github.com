In my opinion, **Curtis Huttenhower** presented the newest perspectives for understanding human microbiome. Some ideas from his talk:

- Not who, but why: the IBD microbiome is defined by adaptation to oxidative stress.
- Niche specialization is crucial in human microbiome.
- Human Microbiome Project Unified Metabolic Analysis Network: Who's there vs what they're doing.
- Species-level resolution is critical for understanding microbiome function, strain-level is even better.

Some interesting ideas presented at the conference:

**Ian Wilson:**

- Disease and microbiome: causal or casual?
- Recolonization after Atbs resulted in cage-dependent subgroups with different bacterial populations and metabotypes.

**Karen Scott:**

- Anaerobic Roseburia/E. rectale group bacteria constitute 10% of gut microbiota in healthy individuals.
- The main fermentation product of Roseburia species is butyrate. The genomic analysis of the enzymes involved is complex.
- Dietary interventions (augmenting the amount of starch consumed) can dramatically affect Roseburia genus presence in gut.

**Barbara Pachikian:**

- Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) supplementation reverses hepatic steatosis.

**Francisco Guarner:**

- In IBD mucosal lesions are caused by immune response against colonic bacteria.

**Paul Cotter:**

- Bacteriocins as tools to alter the composition of gut microbiota.

**Ruth Ley:**

- In the third trimester of pregnancy gut bacterial composition shows a dramatic shift.
- The third trimester microbiota could induce low-grade inflammation, adiposity gain and reduced insulin sensitivity beneficial in pregnancy R.Ley
- Gut microbiota's impact on metabolism: highly adaptive in pregnancy and detrimental in obese host.

**Fredrik Backhed:**

- Apoe -/- germ-free male mice are resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis.
- Gut microbiota modulate bile acid synthesis.

**Simon Murch:**

- There are differences between the flora from cesarean infants and from vaginally delivered infants.
- Different bacteria induce different gene expression in the host
- Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical for microbial diversity in low birth weight neonates.

**A. Walker:**

- CF infants have more pathogenic bacteria in their lower respiratory microbiota (P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, B. cepacia)

**Elisa Noll:**

- Gut-microbial metabolism can alter host metabolism in the favour of obesity and insulin resistance.

**Fergus Shanaham:**

- What is a healthy gut? Low biodiversity implies more pathogens colonization.

**Douwe van Sinderen:**

- Bifidobacterial pili and surface polysaccharide allow competitive host colonization and persistence
-Perhaps genes involved in colonization are not expressed in vitro.

**Catarina Simoes:**

- Diet affects the gut microbiota in twins.

**Kathleen Sim:**

- Missing bifidobacteria: undercounting in neonatal gut microbiota using classical universal primers.

**Julian Marchesi:**

- Experiments colonizing gut from mices with human microbiota
- Core functions of gut microbiota need to be useful to the host but at the same time to the bacteria.

**Willem de Vos:**

- Gut microbiome with low diversity in colitis
- Ileum microbiota is shaped by fast sugar uptake
- Microbiota diversity likely to provide resilience
- Diversity and stability characterize a healthy microbiome.

**Jeremy K. Nicholson:**

- There are many more targets for cancer in human microbiome than in human genome
- The microbiome as a therapeutic target
- Influence of maternal genome on early microbiome development.
