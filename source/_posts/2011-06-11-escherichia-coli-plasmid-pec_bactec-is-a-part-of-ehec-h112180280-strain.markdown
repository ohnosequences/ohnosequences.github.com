As it was suggested by Kat Holt ([http://bacpathgenomics.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/ehec-genomes-snp-locations/](http://bacpathgenomics.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/ehec-genomes-snp-locations/)) and others a plasmid very similar to pEC_Bactec is a part of the genome of the recently sequenced EHEC H112180280 strain.

The figure displays a simple alignment obtained using MAUVE  Move Contigs tool between pEC_Bactec plasmid (above) and the scaffolds 7 and 13 of H112180280 genome (below):

Scaffolds 7 and 13 cover practically all pEC-Bactec plasmid sequence. The two white `pEC-Bactec` regions that hasn't associated similar regions in `H112180280` correspond to the genes:

- `pndC` and  `TnpA OrfB IS66` (the left white region into the red similarity block)
- `TnpA IS26` transposase (The white patch into the blue block)

The `H112180280` sequence regions without any similarity conexion with  `pEC-Bactec` flanking the two little green blocks correspond to N regions that remain undefined in the `H112180280` sequence obtained with paired end 454 technology.
