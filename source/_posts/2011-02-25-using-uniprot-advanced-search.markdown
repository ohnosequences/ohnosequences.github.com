This short post shows how to use Uniprot Advanced search to retrieve proteins of interest. In this Biostar [question](http://biostar.stackexchange.com/questions/5862/how-to-retrieve-human-proteins-sequence-containing-a-given-domain) they want to retrieve human proteins with the domain "FYVE"

First click on _Advanced search_ in Uniprot (www.uniprot.org) website

Then select _Domain_ in the field box and type _FYVE_

Click then _Add & Search_ and select now _Organism_ in the Field box and type _Homo sapiens_.

Clicking again on _Add & Search_ you get your set of proteins. And if you click on _Download_ on the right you can download the data in several formats.

Similar searches (and more complex ones) can be done combining the logical operators and the available fields.
