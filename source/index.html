<p><em>Oh no sequences!</em> is the R&amp;D (Research and Development) group at <a href="http://era7bioinformatics.com">era7 bioinformatics</a>. </p>
<p>We work on things related with bioinformatics (NGS data analysis), (mostly bacterial) genomics, cloud computing, graph databases, and even category theory! more on our interests at <a href="/about">about</a>. </p>
<p>You can get a general overview of what we do by looking at a sample of our current <a href="/projects">projects</a>, or by going to our <a href="https://github.com/ohnosequences">github account</a>: <strong>everything</strong> we do is <strong>open source</strong> (concretely <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPLv3</a> licensed). And of course there's also the <a href="/publications">publications</a> page, or our <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>
<p>We are a healthy mix of people with wildly different backgrounds: Biology, Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Mathematics. Take a look at <a href="/people">people</a> for the whole list.</p>
