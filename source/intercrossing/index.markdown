_INTERCROSSING_ is an EU-funded Marie Curie Initial Training Network of which we are members, focused on Next Generation Sequencing, Cloud Computing and Population Genetics. As part of it two _early stage researchers_ (ESRs):

- [Alexey Alekhin](/aalekhin)
- [Evdokim Kovach](/ekovach) 

will obtain PhD-level training as members of our group, under the supervision of [Eduardo Pareja](/epareja), [Raquel Tobes](/rtobes) and [Eduardo Pareja-Tobes](eparejatobes).

We also organized a one week intensive course in [Cloud Computing and NGS data analysis]() for all the 13 _INTERCROSSING_ ESRs; most of the slides from that course are available [here](/slides/intercrossing-course)
