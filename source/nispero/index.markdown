![nispero](nispero.png)

_Nispero_ is a Scala library for declaring stateless computations and scaling them using a combination of services from AWS. Highlights are

- strongly typed configuration (Scala code!)
- automatic deploy/undeploy
- CRDT-like semantics (a _nispero_ instance is essentially a morphism between idempotent commutative monoids)

See the [nispero documentation](https://github.com/ohnosequences/nispero/blob/master/doc/README.md) for more details.
