### bio

Hi! I'm Eduardo Pareja-Tobes, and I am leading **maths** / **computer science** research at _oh no sequences!_. My educational background is in **category theory** and related matters; I love abstract stuff. But I also enjoy coding and working with machines: I have **+6 years** of **cloud computing** experience and somewhere around **4 years** with **Scala**.
