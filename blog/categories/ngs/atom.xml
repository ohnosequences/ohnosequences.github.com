    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been <em>years</em> since we started working on <a href="http://bio4j.com">Bio4j</a>, and during all this time we have prioritized working on Bio4j over writing about (and publishing) what we were doing. Thanks in part to this, Bio4j 1.0 is going to be an amazing resource for the Bioinformatics community, built by only a handful of people; which I personally found quite impressive, given the scale and scope of the project. </p>

<p>However, not having a standard way of citing Bio4j was starting to cause some difficulties for Bio4j users; a link to a GitHub repository is (still) not a generally accepted practice. This was so even for ourselves: we have several papers in the works which build on Bio4j, blocked because it would not make sense to publish them before Bio4j itself.</p>

<p>Well, this is no longer an issue: yesterday a preprint in the <a href="http://biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> went online, describing what is Bio4j</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/20/016758">Bio4j: a high-performance cloud-enabled graph-based data platform</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We chose the bioRxiv because preprints there are easily citable (they get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a> assigned), and several open-access journals are happy with publishing a manuscript based on a preprint submitted to it (something which we will certainly do in the next few months).</p>

<p>I’m including below the citing info and abstract; any sort of feedback is welcome!</p>

<p><em>Pablo Pareja-Tobes, Raquel Tobes, Marina Manrique, Eduardo Pareja, Eduardo Pareja-Tobes</em> <br />
<strong>bioRxiv</strong> – <strong>doi</strong>: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/016758">10.1101/016758</a></p>

<!-- ### Abstract -->

<p><strong>Background.</strong> Next Generation Sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have brought a revolution to the bioinformatics landscape, by offering sheer amounts of data about previously unaccessible domains in a cheap and scalable way. However, fast, reproducible, and cost-effective data analysis at such scale remains elusive. A key need for achieving it is being able to access and query the vast amount of publicly available data, specially so in the case of knowledge-intensive, semantically rich data: incredibly valuable information about proteins and their functions, genes, pathways, or all sort of biological knowledge encoded in ontologies remains scattered, semantically and physically fragmented.</p>

<p><strong>Methods and Results.</strong> Guided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph models. We have modeled and integrated most publicly available data linked with proteins into a set of interdependent graphs. Data querying is possible through a data model aware Domain Specific Language implemented in Java, letting the user write typed graph traversals over the integrated data. A ready to use cloud-based data distribution, based on the Titan graph database engine is provided; generic data import code can also be used for in-house deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Bio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for several key problems: data integration; expressive, high performance data access; and a cost-effective scalable cloud deployment model.</p>

    <id>http://ohnosequences.com/blog/2013/12/03/intercrossing-cloud-and-ngs-course</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the past August we gave a course as part of the <a href="http://intercrossing.wikispaces.com/"><em>INTERCROSSING</em></a> Initial Training Network we are part of. The course was titled <em>Cloud Computing and NGS Data Analysis</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/intercrossing-cloud-course.jpg"></p>

<p>The audience composition was a mix of Biologists, Mathematicians, Bioinformaticians and Statisticians; we tried to have something for all of them. </p>

<p>We set 3 working groups with a mix of people with different backgrounds, in every group you could find <em>bio</em> and <em>maths/CS</em> guys. We made up these <em>interdisciplinary</em> teams on purpose, we wanted to simulate as much as possible the kind of working environment they could find in <em>real</em> world with its pros and cons like the advantage of being able to learn one from others but also the difficulties of understanding people with completely different background.</p>

<p>From the beginning the students were given a problem to solve: <em>outbreak pathogen identification</em>. And they were asked to design a system to face it. We wanted them to come up with a solution as realistic as possible. We picked a challenging problem with no define solution to enhance their creativity and to make them work hard on something in a similar scenario of <em>real life</em> problems. We were not so interested in a given solution but in how they faced the problem and designed a solution from scratch. We really wanted them to think about a <em>real life</em> problem and we think we got it.</p>

<p>So, we scheduled the talks in a way that the first days they could get some general concepts they would need to face the problem and from then on they also had sessions for team working and asking questions. On Friday each team explained the others their system.</p>

<p>It was a pretty intensive week for them and for us! We had a great time supervising their work and watching from the background how they developed their projects. We hope they enjoyed the course as much as we did!</p>

  <li>Niche specialization is crucial in human microbiome.</li>
  <li>Human Microbiome Project Unified Metabolic Analysis Network: Who’s there vs what they’re doing.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Elisa Noll:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Gut-microbial metabolism can alter host metabolism in the favour of obesity and insulin resistance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fergus Shanaham:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What is a healthy gut? Low biodiversity implies more pathogens colonization.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Douwe van Sinderen:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bifidobacterial pili and surface polysaccharide allow competitive host colonization and persistence

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I published a post describing how to obtain <a href="http://blog.bio4j.com/2011/11/cool-go-annotation-visualizations-with-gephi-bio4j/">cool GO annotation visualizations with Gephi + Bio4j</a>. As an example I used data from one of the first assemblies for the **EHEC **genome, and I was wondering today: Why not using the last version from BGI assembly we annotated with <a href="http://bg7.ohnosequences.com/">our great <strong>BG7 bacterial genome annotation pipeline</strong></a> and put together the visualizations for the three sub-ontologies? Here you have the result:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And right now we’ve finished the automatic annotation of the assembly of new strain that HPA (<a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/">Health Protection Agency UK</a>)  made available yesterday (get the assembly file here <a href="http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/lgp/resource/454Scaffolds.fna">http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/lgp/resource/454Scaffolds.fna</a>)</p>

<p>Once more we’ve used <a href="http://bg7.ohnosequences.com">BG7</a> and the same set of reference proteins (137,063 proteins in total):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The representative Uniprot proteins corresponding to all Uniref90 clusters for all Escherichia coli proteins</li>
  <li>All Uniprot proteins from organisms including in their name the terms “EHEC” or “EAEC”</li>
  <li>All Uniprot proteins from bacteria that have in any Uniprot field the term “toxin”</li>
  <li>All Uniprot proteins from bacteria that have in any Uniprot field  “hemolysin”</li>
  <li>All the proteins from Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis and Shigella dysenteriae</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>We’ve detected 5,916 genes</p>

<ul>
  <li>5,792 protein encoding genes</li>
  <li>124 RNA genes</li>
</ul>

<p>4,912 out of the 5,792 (84.80%) protein encoding genes have canonical start and stop codon and haven´t either frame-shifts or intragenic stop codons.</p>

<p>615 out of the 5,792 (10.61%) protein encoding genes have some frameshifts or intragenic stop codon in their sequences, probably caused by inherent technology errors.</p>
